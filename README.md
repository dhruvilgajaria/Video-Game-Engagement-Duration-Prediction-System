# Video-Game-Engagement-Duration-Prediction-System

In this gaming analytics project, two sophisticated machine learning models were developed. The first, a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model built with TensorFlow, predicts user-game interactions, specifically whether a user would play a given game. The second model employs collaborative filtering to estimate log-transformed playtime. Training involved mixed user-game data for the BPR model and user/game biases for playtime prediction. Both models were rigorously evaluated, the first for accuracy and the second using Mean Squared Error (MSE), showcasing the power of machine learning in understanding user engagement in gaming.
